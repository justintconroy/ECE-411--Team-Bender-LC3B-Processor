********Description of Blocks and Components********

ADDRSplitter: This block splits the incoming address to the cache into the Tag, Index, and Offset bits.

Way:  This components plays the role of the way.  There are two of them used in the design.  Both include a data array, a valid bit array, a dirty bit array, and a tag array.

OneNSDelay:  This is a block that delays a std_logic in value by 1ns.

TagCompare:  This component does a compare of two 9 bit values and outputs the result.  There are two of them used by both of the Ways, and they determine whether the tag of the address is stored in either Way.

Rip3offset:  This component takes a 4bit value and rips and outputs the high 3 bits.  This is used to get the high 3 bits of the offset so that they can be used as a select for a 16bit value in th 128bit lines.

oWordMux8:  This s a mux that accepts a 128bit value as its input and selects which 16bit value within that input to output to the main data path via DATAIN.

ADDRcomb:  This is used to form a 16bit address for a line that is to be evicted from a Way.  It recieves the tag of the soon to be evicted line and the Index.  It 0 pads the last 4 bits since the offset is not needed to store a line in the memory.

LRU: This block serves as the LRU for both Ways.  It consist of a 8 bit array.  It recieves the Prehit1 value, Index, and Hit as inputs.  If a hit occurs, the current Index value into the 8 bit array is updated with the Prehit1 signal.  This successfully stores the least recently used way for each set.

Dclk:  Delays the main clk by 34ns.  This is used to avoid certain timing errors.

HitGateMaker:  ANDS the delayed clock from the dclkout and the inverse of the clock to create the Hitgate signal, which defines a window for which the hit signal is reliable.  

WriteComb: This is a hieracichal block that contains the various components of the Write Combiner.  Its function is to allow writes to the data within the Ways.  Below is a list of its internal components.

Decoder8:  This component takes a 3 bit value and, in the fashion of a decoder, outputs a 8 bit value that asserts only the 1 bit that is represented by the 3 bit value.  For example, when A = 010, the output F = 00000100.

Decoder8split: Splits an 8 bit value into 8 seperate std_logic values.  This is used by the decoder so that each of its bits can be sent to their corresponding CacheWriter and be used as a select.

Linesplitter:  Splits an incoming 128 bit value into eight 16 bit values which are sent to their corresponding CacheWriter.

LineJoiner:  Combines eight 16bit values into a single 128 bit value so that the data can be written back to a Way.

CacheWriter:  A hierarcichal component that determines if any of the 2 Bytes of one of the Word values within the 128bit line are to be overwritten with new data from the main Datapath.  Below is a list of its components.

WordSplitter:  Splits a 16bit value into its upper and lower bytes.

WordComb:  Joins two 8 bit values to create the upper and lower bytes of the a 16bit value.

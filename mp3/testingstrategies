***********Testing Strategies*********

To begin with testing, I started by testing a few load instructions to verify that my MP2.2read design had not been damaged in the modification process.  After this, I continued by testing simple things like a store to a memory location that was already inside of my cache. 

After convincing myself that my basic cache stores were working properly, I moved on to test that my store byte instruction was working correctly.  After confirming this, I tested that my eviction policy was in full effect.  To do this, I wrote to a line in my cache and then loaded a line that I knew would evict it, forcing the cache to write the line back into main memory.  This was probably the most challenging thing for me.  

After convincing myself that the evict policy was working, I began more general test that included cache misses, hits, and evictions mixed together.  Once I my processor passed those test, I began testing my design against the code given by the TAs and comparing my results with others.

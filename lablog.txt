 Layed down initial components/framework for pipeline design. The design
 will be very hierarchical to facilitate more than one person working
 on different parts of the processor at the same time. To this end, I've
 made (and color-coded) more different components for each stage of the
 pipeline.
 I've also spent some of this time trying to set up a git repository on
 github in the hopes that it will be useful. I need to check to make sure
 my teammates are comfortable with using git.
